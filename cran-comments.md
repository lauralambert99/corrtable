##Resubmission
This is a resubmission.  In this version I have:

* Addressed potentially misspelled words in DESCRIPTION.  Hmisc is a package name and
  not misspelled. csv was changed to .csv2; it is a file extension and not misspelled.
  dataframe is describing an input type and is not misspelled.

*Addressed Description field starting with 'This package'
