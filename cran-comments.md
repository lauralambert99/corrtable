##Resubmission
This is a resubmission.  In this version I have:

*surrounded package name and API in ''

*added () after functions in DESCRIPTION

*added references describing methods in package

*removed \dontrun{} from save_correlation_matrix()

*removed the install of 'Hmisc' within correlation_matrix() function

*added Output information for save_correlation_matrix()

*dataframe is not a potentially misspelled word
