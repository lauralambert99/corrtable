Description: Creates a correlation table (full, upper, or lower 
  diagonal) and includes asterisks for p-values.  Input can be a full dataframe;
  strings and Boolean terms will be dropped as part of functionality.  Correlations and
  p-values are calculated using the Hmisc framework.  Output of the 
  correlation_matrix function is a table of strings; this gets saved out to a .csv2
  with the save_correlation_matrix function for easy insertion into a paper.
