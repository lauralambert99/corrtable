Description: After using this, a publication-ready correlation table with p-values
  indicated will be created.  The input can be a full dataframe; any
  string and Boolean terms will be dropped as part of functionality.  Correlations and
  p-values are calculated using the 'Hmisc' framework.  Output of the 
  correlation_matrix() function is a table of strings; this gets saved out to a '.csv2'
  with the save_correlation_matrix() function for easy insertion into a paper.
